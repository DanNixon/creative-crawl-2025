Hello… and welcome.

Before you, are a collection of talismans, each one suspended by a single thread.
Every talisman holds a different kind of horror — one drawn from the many ways we tell stories to frighten ourselves.

When you’re ready, return this phone to its receiver.
Then, choose a talisman and give it a gentle pull.
The phone will ring… and a story will come calling.

Oh, and please ensure that the door is fully closed once you have had your fill.
