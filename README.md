# Creative Crawl 2025 - Maker Space box

Code, CAD and other stuffs for the [Maker Space](https://www.makerspace.org.uk/) contribution to the [Orbis Community Gateshead Creative Crawl 2025](https://www.orbiscommunity.com/gateshead-creative-crawl).

Well, most of it.
The external artwork was done by Iain, so the cad for those templates is not here.
This is just the stuff I did.

## What is it?

TL;DR.
A decorated box with a phone and some switches.
Press a switch, get an AI generated and narrated horror story.

There is some attempt at atmosperic lighting using [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/).
