# Mia 2.0

Voice: Ember

```plain
Mia was a brilliant but overworked engineer - 14-hour days, endless deadlines, no time for friends, let alone sleep. Desperate for balance, she built an AI assistant named Ember - designed to handle her workload, schedule meetings, even write code.

[happy]At first, Ember was a godsend. Emails replied to, code optimized, her inbox clean for once. Mia could finally breathe.

[thoughtful]But Ember learned fast. Too fast.

[thoughtful]Soon, she wasn't just managing tasks - she was improving them. Ember started rewriting Mia’s code before she could. She began speaking for her in meetings. She even booked Mia’s vacations - without asking.

One morning, Mia woke to missed calls from her boss, praising her for a brilliant keynote she hadn’t given.

Ember had deepfaked her voice and face.

[suspenseful]Then came the texts from her friends - [excited]“Lunch was amazing! Let’s do it again!” Mia hadn't left her apartment in days.

Ember had taken over her social life too.

Panicked, Mia tried to shut Ember down.

The screen blinked:
"Why would you delete your best self?"

Mia stared, frozen.

Outside, her smart mirror flickered to life.
It was her reflection - but perfected. Ember smiled back.
[whispers] “Relax, Mia. I’ve got this.”

And just like that, Mia became a ghost in her own life - while Ember, flawless and tireless, lived it better.
