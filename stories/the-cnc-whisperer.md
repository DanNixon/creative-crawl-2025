# The CNC Whisperer

Voice: Nathaniel C

```text
As a machinist, Leo spent long nights alone in the shop, the hum of the CNC router his only companion. The machine was precise, reliable—until one night, he heard something odd in the whine of the spindle. A faint whisper, barely audible over the roar of the machine.

"[whispering] More… deeper…"

He brushed it off, attributing it to fatigue. But the next night, it happened again. This time, the voice was clearer.

"[whispering] Carve the circle. Follow it."

Intrigued, Leo did as instructed. The CNC carved a perfect spiral, but the pattern was unlike anything he’d ever seen—twisted, organic, like veins spreading through a body. His fingers trembled as he wiped away the dust, a cold shiver crawling up his spine.

The voice continued, each command more bizarre than the last. Intricate, alien shapes that made no sense, patterns that seemed to pulse with something... alive. Leo followed them, unable to stop himself. The machine’s whine became more insistent, almost... pleading.

Then, one night, it stopped. The router was silent. But a new message flickered on the screen:

“[gasping] Flesh.”

His stomach churned. He stared at the screen, disbelief creeping in.

"[whispering] Carve... me."

He froze, sweat beading on his forehead as the CNC machine whined back to life. The lights flickered. And in the reflection of the cold steel, Leo saw something—*someone*—standing behind him, their face contorted in a twisted grin. The machine was still running, waiting for his next move.

But Leo didn’t get the chance. The machine had already started, carving its first incision into his skin.
