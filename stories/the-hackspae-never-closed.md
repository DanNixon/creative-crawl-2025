# The Hackspace Never Closed

Voice: Blondie

```text
The hackspace had been shut down after the fire—everything reduced to a charred skeleton of old computers, half-built drones, and scorched workbenches. The crew had barely escaped that night, the air thick with smoke, the sparks of the electrical fire still flashing like lightning in the dark.

But a few of them—brave, or maybe just stubborn—decided to go back. They needed parts, tools, anything salvageable. As they stepped into the building, the acrid smell of burnt plastic and wood still hung in the air.

But... [short pause] something was wrong.

The lights flickered above them, casting strange shadows along the walls. The hum of machines that had once been powered down now buzzed through the silence. In the far corner, a welding torch sputtered in the dark, its flame casting a sickly orange glow.

“[whispering] Who's still here?” one of the crew whispered, but his voice trembled, unsure.

No one answered.

They moved toward the welding sound, their footsteps echoing in the empty, decaying space. The closer they got, the clearer it became: someone—or something—was working on something. Sparks flew into the air as the figure bent over their work, the rhythmic hiss of the torch blending with the soft whir of machinery.

“[calling out] Hello?” one of them called, stepping closer.

The figure paused. Slowly, it turned. Its face was obscured by a metal mask, but behind it, where once there had been eyes, now there were only black sockets, wide and empty.

A voice rasped from behind the mask: [raspy voice] “I’m just finishing... the upgrade."

Then the torch flared, and the lights went out.

No one made it out of the hackspace that night.

The next morning, the building was silent once more. The fire had claimed everything—except the machines, which hummed quietly, as if waiting for the next upgrade.
