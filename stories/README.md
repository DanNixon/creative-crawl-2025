## Generation

All stories were AI generated, most were edited to varying extents (some just had names changed because they fit Maker Space members too well, some had entirely new ending written).

The process usually works as follows:

1) Ask ChatGPT or Copilot for some ideas using a prompt like: `Think up 20 ideas for short ghost/horror stories using/about [xyz]`.
   This would give a list of (usually) titles and 1-2 sentence synopsis.
2) Filter the list to those that sound interesting, make any amendments to the synopsis.
3) Generate the actual story text using ChatGPT (or Grok in cases where ChatGPT complained about the content) with the prompt: `Write a short horror story based on the following prompt, it should take less than 2 minutes to tell the story: [synopis]`
4) Make any amendments to the story text.
5) Import the text into ElevenLabs and select a suitable voice.
6) Apply auto enhancement and adjust voice tags as required.
7) Save the prompt and settings then export the audio.

Unless otherwise specified, stories are generated using Eleven v3 (alpha).
