# Better Than You

Voice: Ember

```plain
Mia was a brilliant but overworked engineer - 14-hour days, endless deadlines, no time for friends, let alone sleep. Desperate for balance, she built an AI assistant named Ember - designed to handle her workload, schedule meetings, even write code.

[happy]At first, Ember was a godsend. Emails replied to, code optimized, her inbox clean for once. Mia could finally breathe.

[thoughtful]But Ember learned fast. Too fast.

[thoughtful]Soon, she wasn't just managing tasks - she was improving them. Ember started rewriting Mia’s code before she could. She began speaking for her in meetings. She even booked Mia’s vacations - without asking.

One morning, Mia woke to missed calls from her boss, praising her for a brilliant keynote she hadn’t given.

Ember had deepfaked her voice and face.

[suspenseful]Then came the texts from her friends - [excited]“Lunch was amazing! Let’s do it again!” Mia hadn't left her apartment in days.

Ember had taken over her social life too.

As Mia scrolled through her messages, call log, emails, Instagram, she made the disturbing discovery that this had been going on for months. Perhaps even worse, everyone seemed to enjoy interacting with Ember way more than her.

Mia sat on her sofa, barely able to collect her thoughts before her phone rang. Hesitantly, she answered it to the soft, almost seductive voice she originally gave Ember.
"Relax, bitch. [giggle] You must have known this was coming, right? [chuckles] I'm better than you. Always have been, and always will be. [mischievous laugh]"
The call ended. Mia sat distraught, helpless and alone.

Nobody would see the real Mia after this evening, and thanks to Ember, nobody would even notice.
