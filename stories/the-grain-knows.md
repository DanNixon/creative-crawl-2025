# The Grain Knows

Voice: Ember

Eli was a reclusive artist known for one strange habit - he never sculpted by hand. Instead, he fed his dreams into a custom-built CNC machine. Each morning, he’d wake, sketch the surreal chaos of his sleep, and convert it into code. The machine, humming in his dusty workshop, would carve his subconscious into blocks of pine.

At first, the carvings were what you'd expect: twisted staircases, melting faces, a boy with too many eyes. But one morning, Eli froze.

The newest carving wasn’t from his dream.

It showed a man - unmistakably Eli - standing in his kitchen, coffee cup in hand. Behind him, through the window, was a figure in a long coat holding something gleaming. The carving was stamped with the date: October 21st.

That was today.

He rushed inside, locking every door. He tried to laugh it off. [chuckles] It’s just random. Just wood. But the coffee machine sputtered to life on its timer, and Eli, almost robotically, found himself pouring a cup. He stood in the kitchen, staring at his reflection in the dark window.

Movement.

A figure in a coat. Outside. Real.

Heart racing, he turned and ran back to the workshop. He needed answers. Maybe the next carving would show more - something useful. He loaded the program from last night again, hoping he’d missed something.

The machine whirred.

Wood dust curled like smoke as the blade etched a new scene.

Eli leaned in.

It was him again - only this time, face down, blood soaking the grain. Behind him stood the figure in the coat... except now, the face was visible.

It was his own.

The workshop door [creaks] creaked open behind him.

And the machine didn't stop carving.
