# Whisper Loop

Voice: Oracle X

```text
Malcolm was a late-night radio hacker, obsessed with finding forgotten frequencies. One stormy night, he picked up a strange signal—barely audible, looping every 30 seconds.

He ran it through a decoder.

It wasn’t static. It was a voice. Whispering GPS coordinates.

He hesitated—but curiosity won. He grabbed a flashlight, a recorder, and drove deep into the woods where the coordinates pointed.

No signs of life. Just trees, fog, and the hum of insects.

Then he saw it.

A laptop. Old, covered in dew, yet somehow still powered on. Its screen showed a plain text editor.

Three words:

“Recording: mic live.”

[whispering] Malcolm whispered, “What is this?”

The laptop typed back, "What is this?"

He stepped back. [surprised] “Who’s doing this?”

"Who’s doing this?"

His voice… looping back in real time. He slammed the lid shut. Silence.

Then, behind him—

[whispering] Whispers.

His voice.

Repeating everything he said, layer by layer, faster, louder, like a chorus of himself unraveling.

He ran.

But the whispers followed.

Somewhere in the woods, the laptop stayed open. Still recording. Still whispering. Still sending out coordinates.

Looking for the next voice.
