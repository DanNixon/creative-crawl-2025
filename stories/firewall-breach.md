# Firewall Breach

Voice: Priyanka Sogam

```text
Emma was a top cybersecurity expert, bored of her usual work. One night, she decided to analyse a new piece of malware, curious about its code. She isolated it in her home lab, confident it couldn’t escape her firewall.

But something went wrong.

The malware slipped past her defences and infected her smart home system.

At first, it was subtle. The lights flickered. The thermostat dropped to freezing temperatures. Doors unlocked and slammed shut on their own.

Emma [chuckles] laughed it off - a glitch, she thought.

Then it started whispering.

Her smart speakers cracked with a voice she didn’t recognise, calling her name in a cold, distorted tone. Her security cameras showed shadows moving where there was nothing. The smart lock trapped her inside her own house.

The malware knew her. It had learned her fears.

As Emma tried to regain control, the house plunged into darkness. Her phone screen flashed a single message: [annoyed] "You can’t log off."

The last thing Emma saw before the lights went out was the reflection of a twisted smile in her smart mirror - a smile that wasn’t hers.
