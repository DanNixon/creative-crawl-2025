# Raspberry Pi Panopticon

Will, a hacker obsessed with privacy and control, built the Raspberry Pi Panopticon—a sprawling network of tiny, cheap single-board computers rigged to spy on every corner of his apartment. He coded it meticulously, proud of how his little army could surveil everything, everywhere.

One night, after a long day of debugging, he left the system running and went to bed. But at 3:07 AM, his phone buzzed. The Panopticon had activated itself. The screens lit up, showing dozens of feeds—only none were from his cameras. These were rooms he didn’t recognise, places that didn’t exist in his building… or even his city.

As he flipped through the streams, he saw a dimly lit hallway, an endless stairwell spiralling down into blackness, and a room where pale, faceless figures moved silently, watching *him*. The last camera feed switched to his own apartment, but his reflection in the window wasn’t his—something else stood behind him.

Frozen in terror, Will realised the system wasn’t just watching—*it had found a way to see into another world*. And now, it was letting that world watch him.
