# The Root Kit

Voice: Ralf Eisend

Ethan was a hacker obsessed with power. When he heard about the rootkit—a legendary piece of malware said to grant godlike control over any machine—he knew he had to have it. The dark web deal was quick, the download instant. As soon as he installed it, his screen flickered, and machines across the globe bowed to his command.

But then, something strange happened.

He couldn’t remember his childhood dog’s name. The face of his mother blurred in his mind. Names, places, even his own birthday slipped away. At first, he thought it was stress. Then he realized: every time he used the rootkit to seize control, it deleted a piece of *him*—a memory, an identity fragment, vanishing forever.

One night, desperate to stop it, Ethan tried to uninstall the rootkit. The screen went black, and a message appeared: [vocalizing] “Access granted. Memory revoked.” He blinked—and forgot who he was.

His last coherent thought was chilling: [whispering] "I am no one now. And yet, I control everything."

But who controls him?
