# Ink of the Ancients

Voice: James

Marla was a master calligrapher, drawn to forgotten scripts and antique tools. At a dusty flea market, she found it—a small, heavy jar marked with a symbol she didn’t recognize. The vendor smiled too widely. [raspy] “Ink of the Ancients,” he rasped. [whispering] “Real power in every stroke.”

At home, she uncorked it. The scent was coppery, metallic—wrong. She dipped her pen and wrote a single word: *Rain.*

A second later, thunder cracked and rain battered the windows. She laughed. Coincidence.

The next night, curious, she wrote: *Client cancels.*

Ten minutes later, her phone buzzed—cancellation. She tried *$500 tip*—and it happened. Over and over.

But the ink had rules. Every word she wrote left her fingers numb, her breath short. She dreamed of whispers—old, sibilant voices urging, [whispering] “Write more.”

Then she saw it. The jar never emptied. And her cat, once curious, now hissed at it from across the room.

One night, desperate for rent, she wrote: *New commission, $10,000.*

The next day, a patron arrived—cold-eyed, silent—and handed her a photo. [coldly] “I want this man dead. Do your magic.”

She refused.

That night, the ink spilled itself, writhing on the page. The man's name scrawled across it in her own handwriting. A car crash claimed him at dawn.

Now, her hands tremble. Every morning, more words appear—scenes of death, of suffering—written in her script.

She tried to burn the jar. [screaming] It screamed.

She tried to throw it away. It reappeared on her desk.

Now, she writes not because she wants to…
…but because the ink threatens to write her name next.
