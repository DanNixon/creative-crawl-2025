# The Redstone Prison

Voice: Arabella

```text
It started as just another late night at the hackspace. Chris, hoodie up, headset on, was deep into a solo Minecraft build—an underground city lit only by redstone lamps. Everyone else had gone home, leaving the place quiet except for the hum of servers and Chris’s clicking keyboard.

Around 2 a.m., his screen glitched—briefly, like static—and then something strange happened.

His avatar stopped responding to controls.

[muttering] "Buggy update," he muttered, shaking the mouse. But then the game moved without him.

Chris’s vision blurred. His hands went cold. The room twisted, pixelated—and he blacked out.

When he opened his eyes… he was in the game.

Not controlling the player. Inside the player.

He stood in the redstone-lit city he’d built—but now the walls loomed like prison bars. His own voice echoed weirdly in his ears, and when he screamed for help, it only came out in chat:
[panicked] “Help me. I’m stuck.”

At first, other players thought it was a joke.

[chuckles] “Nice RP lol.”
[casual] “Cool mod, dude.”

He tried again.
[frantic] “I’m not roleplaying. I’m really here. I can’t get out.”

Then he typed a message no one could ignore:
[desperate] “Check the hackspace cameras. Look at my chair.”

One of the others did.

The chair was there.

Chris wasn’t.

No one plays on that server anymore. But sometimes, players say they see his messages pop up late at night.

[whispering] Begging for someone to dig him out.
