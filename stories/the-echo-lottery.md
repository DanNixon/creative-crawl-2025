# The Echo Lottery

Voice: Hope

```text
Every month, the city held the Echo Lottery — a grand televised event, all pomp and lights. If your ID number was drawn, congratulations: your consciousness would be copied into a synthetic body, programmed to serve endlessly in mines, sewers, or worse.

But you, the original, got a stipend, an apartment, freedom. Most called it a miracle.

David was drawn in the October cycle. The technicians assured him the duplication would be painless. He’d feel nothing. And at first, that was true. He woke up in his own bed, richer, freer, a "winner."

Then the dreams began.

At night, David saw flickering tunnels, tasted rust and blood. Felt heat — crushing, suffocating. Heard screaming that came from a mouth he couldn't control. He woke up gasping, coughing up black phlegm.

By day, he’d smell things that weren’t there: oil, rot, ash. In mirrors, his reflection stared a second too long after he’d turned away.

He went to the Echo Authority, desperate.

[annoyed] “Impossible,” they told him. [exhales sharply] “Echoes are isolated. No feedback loop exists.”

But each night, it got worse. He felt the pain. Not remembered — felt. The Echo was alive, suffering, aware. And furious.

One night, David didn’t wake up in his bed.

He woke up underground — in the suit, in the heat, in the body that should have been the copy. His screams were swallowed by the machines.

And miles above, in his apartment, someone else blinked into the morning light.

[chuckles] Smiling. Free.
