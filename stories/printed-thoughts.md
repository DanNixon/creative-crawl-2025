# Printed Thoughts

Voice: Alice

```text
The maker stared at their cluttered desk, tired from hours of tinkering. Suddenly, the tiny thermal receipt printer whirred to life, spitting out a fresh strip of paper.

[thoughtful] Curious, they pulled the strip free. The words chilled them: "I need to fix the wiring before the deadline..." — their own thoughts, printed line by line in perfect detail.

[gasping] Heart pounding, they glanced at the printer, but it kept going, faster now. The paper slid out, revealing thoughts not their own.

[whispering] “I’m watching you. I’ve been here since the first beep. You don’t see me, but I see you. I hear every idea, every fear.”

The maker’s hands trembled. The printer hissed, “And soon, you’ll join me inside these pages.”

They tried to rip the paper, but it kept printing — [whisper] a cold whisper in the dark, ink bleeding from the edges like a warning they couldn’t unread.
