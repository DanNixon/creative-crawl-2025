# In Warm Blood

Voice: Bradford

```text
In a stinking basement lit by flickering LEDs, Kai traded ten grand and a vial of spinal fluid for a 3D-printed arm — meat and metal fused in greasy layers. The dealer called it Redright, muscle-wrapped and motorized, twitching like it dreamed of violence.

At first, it was perfect. Strong. Precise. Fast. Then, it twitched in his sleep. Twitched toward his chest. When he tried to restrain it, it growled — not with sound, but with vibration, deep in the bones.

By day four, the skin pulsed with fever. The metal plates steamed. The arm dragged him toward heat — microwaves, stovetops, dogs panting in parks.

That night, it clawed at his door until it bled rust. It wanted out.

On day seven, Kai locked it under the floorboards. His body sobbed from the strain, but it was silent. Until midnight.

A voice — his own — whispered from the vent: [whispering] “Just a little blood, Kai. Anyone’s. Yours… or hers.”

Then came footsteps. His girlfriend, visiting early.

The trapdoor creaked.
She ran.
Too late.

[screaming] Screams. [whispering] Then silence.
