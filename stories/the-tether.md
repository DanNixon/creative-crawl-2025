# The Tether

Voice: Ralf Eisend

Alex was a hacker chasing free bandwidth. One night, she tapped into a strange, distant signal—something not from any satellite she knew. The data was unlike anything on Earth: eerie, pulsating, almost alive.

At first, it was just whispers in the static. Then the signal grew louder—more insistent. Alex’s screen flickered with shapes, like shadowy figures pressing against the edges of reality.

She tried to log off. Nothing worked. The signal tethered itself to her connection, feeding off her device, pulling her in.

Then, offline, in the dark silence of her room, Alex saw them—tall, faceless beings standing just beyond the glow of her laptop, watching.

They didn’t need the internet any more. They had found her.
