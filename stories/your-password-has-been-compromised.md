# Your Password Has Been Compromised

Voice: Mark

```text
After the massive data breach, millions received the same email: *“Your password has been compromised.”* Most ignored it, but then the messages changed.

Emma’s phone buzzed at midnight. A text read: *“You forgot to lock your front door tonight.”* [confused] Confused, she checked—door was wide open. She shut it, locking it twice.

The next night, another message: *“You spilled coffee on your laptop—tomorrow, at 3:17 PM.”* [disbelieving] She didn’t believe it. But at exactly 3:17 PM, her hand slipped, coffee splashing over her keyboard.

[panicked] Panic set in. These threats weren’t just about past breaches. They were about future events, details no one else could know.

Then came the final text: *“You’re not going to make it to dawn.”*

[gasping] Emma bolted her windows, hid in her closet. The clock struck midnight. Silence. Then the whisper from her phone: *“[whispering] Your password was never just a password.”*

[ominously] Suddenly, her phone screen went black—and so did the lights.
