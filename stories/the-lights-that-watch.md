# The Lights that Watch

Voice: Juniper

```text
In the dim, cluttered hackspace, the smart lights usually kept everything bright and cheery. But lately, when someone was alone, the lights flickered weirdly—like they were twitching, struggling to form something.

One night, Emma stayed late to finish her project. The room was silent except for the hum of machines. Suddenly, the lights blinked rapidly, rearranging themselves into a grinning human face staring right at her. Frozen with fear, she blinked—and when she looked again, the face was gone.

The next morning, Emma was missing.

[whispering] Whispers spread. Others stayed in groups, but the lights still flickered—always when someone was alone. One by one, members vanished. Each disappearance was preceded by the same chilling vision: the lights twisting into that sinister face, watching, waiting.

No one dared to stay late anymore. But some nights, the hackspace is empty, and the lights pulse softly—like they’re searching for their next victim.

Because the lights don’t just watch. They wait.
