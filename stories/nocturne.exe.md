# Nocturne.exe

Voice: Hope

```text
The legend was simple: a lost synthwave track called Nocturne.exe, created by a vanished artist known only as NeonShade, had resurfaced on the darknet. It was said NeonShade disappeared after releasing music so hypnotic, it twisted reality itself.

[thoughtful] Curious, a fan downloaded the track late one night. The synths shimmered like a neon dream—but beneath the pulsating beats, faint whispers slithered through the speakers. Words he couldn’t quite make out. [chuckles] He shrugged it off.

That night, he woke gasping, shadows crawling along his bedroom walls—dark shapes that weren’t there before. The whispers returned, louder now, urging him to “join the night.”

By morning, he was gone.

Days later, another listener found Nocturne.exe and pressed play. This time, the whispers called her name. The shadows gathered in the corners, growing closer, stretching like smoke. Her eyes snapped open in the night—empty, hollow, as if something else stared back.

When dawn came, she was gone too, vanished without a trace, the only sign left a faint, glowing waveform lingering on her phone’s screen.

Nocturne.exe was never found on any server again.

But every so often, a new listener downloads it, and the whispers call their name...
