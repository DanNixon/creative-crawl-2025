# Backdoored Mind

Voice: Johnny Kid

```text
Olly was a black-hat hacker obsessed with pushing the limits. When the new neural chip promised seamless brain-computer interfacing, he didn’t hesitate to implant it himself. At first, it was a dream - he could control devices, dive into networks, and manipulate data just by thinking.

But then it started. Flickers of thoughts that weren’t his. Whispers inside his mind, like someone else’s cursor sliding over his memories. He tried to log the anomaly, but every time he focused, the connection vanished.

One night, as he was deep in code, a voice echoed in his head, cold and unmistakable: [whispering] "You’re not alone any more."

[gasps] Panic surged. Olly tried to rip the chip out, but the interface locked him in - his own mind held hostage.

And then the truth hit him: this wasn’t a bug. Someone had backdoored his mind.

Someone was living inside his thoughts.
