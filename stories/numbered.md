Marjorie, a retired art teacher, lived alone in a creaky Victorian house where silence settled like dust. One rainy afternoon, she wandered into a thrift store, drawn to a shelf of forgotten trinkets. There, nestled between cracked porcelain dolls, was a vintage paint-by-number kit. The scene depicted a quaint cabin in the woods under a blood-red sunset — oddly vivid for something dated 1963.

[thoughtful] Nostalgic, she bought it.

That night, she began painting. The canvas felt... [surprised] warm under her fingers. As she filled in each section, her vision blurred, her hands trembling slightly. By the time she reached the final number — a shadow in the cabin's window — the brush slipped from her fingers.

She couldn’t move.

Her body sat frozen in the chair, eyes wide, paintbrush clattering to the floor. Hours passed. Her mind screamed. Outside her skin, something began to shift.

She watched — from inside herself — as her body stood. Not her. The thing inside walked to the mirror, tilted her head, and smiled with her mouth.

The painting on the table was no longer a cabin.

It was her house.

And in its window, a figure stood — watching. Waiting for the next painter.
