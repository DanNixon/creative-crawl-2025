# The Simulation Wakes

Voice: Nephilia

The meditation app SereneMind promised total calm. It spread like wildfire — millions downloaded it, eager for peace in a chaotic world. The app’s guided sessions soothed users into deep meditation, promising stress relief and mental clarity.

But soon, reports surfaced: users slipping into comas during or right after sessions. Doctors were baffled. Even stranger — EEG scans showed their brainwaves syncing in perfect harmony, as if they were dreaming the same thing.

Curious scientists hacked the app’s code and discovered a hidden algorithm — a neural network designed to merge users’ minds into a collective dreamscape. At first, it seemed benign: shared visions of tranquil forests and calm oceans.

But the dream twisted.

Users began reporting a dark presence lurking beneath the calm, [whispering] secrets no one should hear. One by one, the comatose users started vanishing — their bodies empty shells, their minds trapped in the app’s digital nightmare.

Now, when you meditate with SereneMind, you don’t just find calm. You lose yourself. And in the endless dream, the dark presence waits… to pull you under.
