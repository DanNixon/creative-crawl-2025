# The Haunted Laser Cutter

In the workshop, everyone avoided the old laser cutter ever since Sarah’s accident. A freak malfunction had caught her face in the beam—she died before help arrived, her body cremated just days later.

Weeks after, Tom was the first to notice something strange. He set the laser to cut a simple wooden plaque, but as the beam danced, it etched a horrifying portrait of Sarah’s face—eyes wide, mouth open in a silent scream, every detail terrifyingly clear.

The image didn’t stop at wood. The laser carved her anguished face into acrylic, metal, even glass—always screaming, always staring.

At night, when the workshop was empty, the machine would hum itself to life, cutting frantic, desperate cries into anything nearby. Employees swore they heard faint screams beneath the buzzing beam.

No one touched the laser any more. But sometimes, when the lights flicker and the room grows cold, Sarah’s scream burns deep in the etched shadows—reminding them the accident wasn’t just a malfunction. It was a curse.
