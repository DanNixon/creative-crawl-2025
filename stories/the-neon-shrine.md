# The Neon Shrine

Voice: John Doe

In the heart of the lawless zone, where chaos ruled and hope was scarce, stood the Neon Shrine. It was a twisted monument of cracked screens, tangled wires, and flickering circuit boards, glowing with an eerie, relentless light.

They said if you prayed there, luck would find you. And it did — at a terrible cost. Every supplicant left with a memory stolen. Sometimes a name, a face, a promise forgotten. Sometimes whole chunks of who they were vanished. Some came back different — cold, empty, or worse, with no personality at all, like hollow shells.

One night, a desperate man named Chris knelt before the shrine, begging for a chance to escape his ruined life. The neon buzzed, the screens flickered wildly. Luck came — a winning lottery ticket in his pocket the next day, a job offer, a second chance.

But when he looked in the mirror, Chris didn’t recognize himself. His eyes were vacant. His smile forced. His memories — gone. The shrine had taken him, piece by piece, until only luck remained. And in the neon glow, the shrine waited for its next visitor, hungry for more souls to feed its endless light.
