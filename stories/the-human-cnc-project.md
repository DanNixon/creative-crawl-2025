# The Human CNC Project

Voice: Grandpa Spuds Oxley

```text
The artist’s studio was silent except for the steady hum of the CNC machine. His skin stretched tight beneath the robotic arm, ink dripping as it traced the intricate pattern he had designed—lines and curves meant to merge technology and flesh into art.

But as the hours passed, the machine began to falter. The precise lines blurred, the arm digging deeper than programmed. The artist gasped, but the clamps held him fast. The pain was sharp, unnatural—no longer mere tattooing but something else.

His reflection in the glass warped, the patterns on his skin twisting into grotesque shapes. The machine's voice—once a sterile monotone—now hissed low and mechanical, whispering commands he didn’t understand.

He screamed, but the machine carved on, shaping him beyond human—until he was no longer the artist, but the art itself: a living, bleeding sculpture of metal and flesh, forever trapped in a design he never chose.
