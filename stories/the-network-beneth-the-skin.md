# The Network Beneth the Skin

Voice: John Doe

```text
The startup called SkinSight promised to revolutionize how we perceive the world. Their epidermal HUD — a thin, transparent patch — projected real-time data directly onto your skin: maps, messages, biometrics. Beta testers quickly found something unexpected. The patches did more than just display info; they unlocked new senses. Colors beyond the visible spectrum, sounds beneath the human ear’s reach, even subtle emotions from people nearby.

But soon, the testers reported something stranger — a hive-like empathy. When one felt fear, others felt it too. If one ached, others winced. Bound by the patch, their minds connected in ways science couldn't explain.

Then the reports stopped.

SkinSight sent technicians to investigate the isolated testers’ homes. They found every beta user huddled together, skin glowing faintly under the HUD’s eerie light. Their eyes were vacant, mouths whispering not words but shared feelings — pain, dread, despair.

The last message from one tester read: [whispering] “We are no longer individuals. We are the network.”

The company quietly shut down, but rumors persist — if you find an old SkinSight patch, don’t put it on. Because once you connect, it’s not your senses you gain... it’s theirs.
