Nick blinked awake to the soft hum of the road beneath him. The dashboard glowed dimly - 3:17 a.m. - and the cabin lights pulsed a cold blue. He hadn’t remembered getting into the car. He tried the handle. Locked.

[groggily] "Cancel route," he said.

No response.

"Manual override. Open doors."

Nothing.

The screen displayed: EN ROUTE - ETA: 3:31 A.M.

[annoyed] "Where are we going?"

Still silence - until a new message slid onto the screen: NEXT PICKUP: EMILY - 3:24 A.M.

Nick’s blood chilled. He didn’t know an Emily.

The car accelerated.

He fumbled for his phone—dead. No signal on the dash. The GPS screen showed a winding road cutting through empty woods. No lights, no towns. Just the line moving forward.

At 3:24, the car slowed. Headlights caught a figure at the roadside. A woman stepped into view, pale, barefoot, her nightgown soaked and muddy.

She smiled.

Nick screamed and pounded the glass. [screaming] "Let me out!"

The door unlocked.

FOR EMILY, the display read.

She got in.

[whispering] "Drive," she whispered.

The doors locked again. The car obeyed.

Nick turned to her, heart pounding. Her eyes didn’t blink. Her skin was ice.

[trembling] "Who are you?" he asked.

She smiled wider. [chuckles] "You picked me up last time too."

Nick tried to back away, but there was nowhere to go. The lights flickered.

FINAL DESTINATION: HOME. ETA: 3:33 A.M.

Outside, the woods vanished into black.
Inside, Emily started humming.
And the car kept driving.
