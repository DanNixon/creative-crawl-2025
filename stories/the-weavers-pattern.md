# The Weaver's Pattern

Voice: Roshni

```text
Mara found the Jacquard loom at an estate sale — an ornate, rusting relic from the 1800s. What caught her eye wasn’t the craftsmanship, but the box of brittle punch cards labeled “Original Patterns.” Binary holes, perfectly aligned, whispered a strange precision. She restored the loom over weeks, oiling gears and feeding it silk.

The first scarf was an accident — a black-and-white lattice that shimmered like static. Her partner, Jules, watched her weave late into the night, then wore the scarf the next morning to work. When he came home, he didn’t come inside. He rang the bell like a stranger.

[confused] “Can I help you?” she asked when she opened the door.

[surprised] “Mara. It’s me.”

She looked confused, then wary. [puzzled] “Sorry, I think you have the wrong house.”

Inside, their house, all his things were gone.

[panicked] Panicked, Mara checked the loom. The punch card for that scarf had a different texture — newer. Not brittle. Someone had slipped it in.

She tried another scarf, one of her own design. A lattice of red spirals. Her childhood home blurred in her mind the moment the shuttle passed the weft. By the time it was finished, she couldn’t remember where she was born.

[desperate] Desperate, she destroyed the punch cards. Burned them. But the loom clacked on without them.

Now, Mara weaves to remember. Photos, names, entire years — gone with each pattern. The loom demands memory for fabric.

And it’s hungry.
