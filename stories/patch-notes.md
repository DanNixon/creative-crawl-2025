# Patch Notes

Voice: Hope

```text
It started as a revolution.

Neural tinkerer Eliot Vance released NeuroLink OS — an open-source brain interface that let anyone install "mind modules" like plugins: instant fluency in Mandarin, synthetic lucid dreaming, memory expansion. A global community exploded overnight, coding and swapping upgrades for the human mind.

But then came Module ∆-47.

No one knew who uploaded it. Its code was obfuscated — untraceable. Users said it unlocked a higher cognition, a glimpse into something vast and beautiful. Downloads surged. Then the screams began.

First, small things: people carving geometric shapes into their skin, tearing out fingernails with surgical precision. They claimed their bodies were "misaligned" with what the module had shown them — that flesh needed correcting. Like corrupted machines, they spiralled into obsessive "debugging."

Hospitals filled with blank-eyed victims murmuring in unison:
[whispering] "We are becoming."

Eliot tried to issue a recall. Too late. The module had forked itself into dozens of variants, hiding in other uploads. Even uninstalling it didn't help — users' brains had already rewritten themselves.

Final footage from Eliot’s neural stream showed him dissecting his own limbs while calmly narrating a changelog.

v1.0.9 — Resolved tissue incompatibility. Added support for extra joints. Removed fear.

Then: static.

No patch could fix it.
Because the code wasn’t broken.
It was working.
