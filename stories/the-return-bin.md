# The Return Bin

Voice: Alice

```text
It started on a Tuesday.

Jill, who volunteered at the community tool library, found the first device in the return bin — a sleek black box with ridges like gills and symbols that shimmered even in the dark. It wasn’t in the inventory. No one claimed it.

By Friday, there were three more. Each one humming faintly, warm to the touch, with screws that didn’t fit any Earth-standard tool. Jill tried to catalog them, but every photo came out blurry, distorted. She joked with her coworker, Marcus, that they looked “alien.”

[annoyed] He didn’t laugh.

Marcus quit that night. Sent a message at 3:17 a.m. saying he’d seen one of the machines open and something long and thin crawl back in. His message ended mid-word. No one’s seen him since.

On Sunday, Jill opened one herself.

She doesn’t remember doing it — just the sound, like breathing through static, and a sudden, overwhelming sense of being watched.

Now, people have started bringing the machines in. Quiet, pale people. Eyes wide. Smiling too much. They never say what the devices are for. Just whisper, “[whispering] It’s broken. It’s ready.”

The tool library’s return bin is full again.

And one of the machines has Jill’s name scratched into it.

In her own handwriting.
