# The Gearhead

Voice: James

```text
Eli was a tinkerer, consumed by the clatter and gleam of steampunk. His workshop glowed with brass and steam, gears ticking like a heartbeat. One night, drunk on ambition, he replaced his left hand with a whirring contraption of cogs and pistons. It worked—beautifully. Stronger, precise, alive with rhythm. He laughed, [chuckles] steam hissing from the joints.

Next came his arm, then his leg, each limb a masterpiece of polished metal and relentless motion. His mirror reflected a half-man, half-machine, eyes wild with creation. But the gears didn’t stop. At night, they turned unbidden, grinding against bone, whispering, [whispering] Deeper. Eli woke to find his brass arm boring into his shoulder, threads of metal weaving into muscle.

He tried to stop it, smashing his tools, but the mechanisms were alive, hungry. They sought his "core"—his heart, his soul, he didn’t know. By dawn, his chest was a lattice of gears, ticking louder, faster. Blood seeped as they drilled inward, seeking something vital. Eli screamed, [screaming] but the gears only sang, [singing] Complete us.

In his final moments, slumped in his workshop, the ticking stopped. His body was still, a perfect machine. But inside, something else turned—a cold, endless rhythm, no longer his own.
