After the oceans swallowed half the cities and the air turned thick as soup, the corporations took control. Money meant nothing any more - but you could sell yourself in pieces. A memory for food, a dream for shelter, a tear for clean water. Everything had a price.

Nina had never sold anything. Not a single fragment. She'd seen what it did to people - hollow-eyed wanderers who couldn’t remember their children or dream anything but static. So she stayed clean. Careful. Unscarred.

[suspenseful] But then, she started losing time.

She’d wake up on street corners, hours missing. Come to with dirt under her nails, bruises she couldn’t explain. Her Account showed no transactions. No transfers. Nothing missing.

At first, she thought it was exhaustion. The world weighed heavy on everyone. But then she found the receipt.

Tucked inside her boot, stained with blood and oil. A corporate stub, marked Extract Complete. No name, no signature - just a barcode and one word: Hope.

Her heart hammered. Hope. That was hers. The feeling she held onto through every storm, every blackout, every whispered suicide.

Nina sprinted to a black-market broker, demanding answers. He scanned the code and went pale.

"This wasn’t a trade," he said. "You didn’t sell anything. This was a collection."

"What?!" [breathes heavily] she breathed. [whispering] "I didn’t owe anything."

He shook his head, backing away. [solemnly] "Someone did - and they used your body as collateral."

Her stomach turned. She thought of her sister, always desperate. Her ex, always charming. Had someone signed her up? Behind her back?

The broker stared at her, eyes wide. [ominously] "They’re not done with you."

She stumbled outside, and the sky dimmed.

Inside her head, something shifted. A thought, almost hers, whispered:

[whispering] Hope was only the beginning.

Then the world went black.
