# The Cursed Carvings

Voice: Grandpa Spuds Oxley

In a dimly lit workshop, prop maker Eli hunched over his workbench, carving intricate runes into a set of talismans for an indie film. The producer, a nervous man named Carl, had dropped off vague sketches and insisted they be "authentic." Eli, meticulous and broke, poured his skill into the task, shaping the cold, obsidian-like stones with eerie precision. The symbols seemed to writhe under his tools, but he chalked it up to late-night fatigue.

By dawn, the five talismans were done, their surfaces glinting unnaturally. Carl arrived, [excited] thrilled, and insisted Eli try one on to "feel the vibe." Reluctantly, Eli slipped a talisman around his neck. A jolt surged through him, like ice in his veins. His vision blurred, and a whisper—[whispering] low, guttural—crawled into his mind: Break. Ruin. Destroy.

Eli’s hands moved on their own, grabbing a hammer. He smashed his workbench, splinters flying, as Carl laughed, thinking it was a prank. But the laughter died when Eli turned, eyes vacant, and lunged. Carl’s scream was cut short as the hammer swung.

Hours later, Eli woke in a haze, the talisman gone. Blood stained his hands. Carl’s body lay crumpled in the corner, and the other talismans were missing. Outside, footsteps echoed in the dark—four sets, moving toward the city, each wearer driven by the same relentless whisper. Eli’s heart pounded. [whispering] What had he unleashed!?
