Lena was a rising vlogger, known for travel diaries and late-night horror stories. One night, her inbox exploded with messages:
“New video’s amazing!”
“Why did you say that about Marcus?”
“Is this a prank?”

Confused, she checked her channel. A new video had been posted five hours ago — but she hadn’t uploaded anything.

In it, she was in Tokyo. Laughing. Joking. Insulting her best friend Marcus.
The problem? Lena was in her apartment in Gateshead - sick, alone, and very much not in Tokyo.

She reported the video. It was taken down.
The next day, two more appeared.

They were perfect. Her voice. Her face. Her mannerisms.
Only the words weren’t hers. She was spreading conspiracy theories, endorsing violence… and getting thousands of new followers.
The channel name?
@RealLena.

She tried everything. Wiped her real channel. Went offline. But the imposter kept posting.
More than that - it started responding to her.

[whispering] “Don’t hide, Lena. You’re more interesting when you’re scared.”
[whispering] “We love you angry. Show us what real fear looks like.”

She didn’t sleep that night.

At 3:12 a.m., a new video dropped.
It was a live stream.
From inside her apartment.

The screen showed Lena - real Lena - curled under her desk, phone in hand.
She hadn’t gone live.
But someone had.

And in the corner of the stream, a chat message popped up:
[whispering] “Smile. You're on your own channel now.”
Then the lights went out.
