# The Feed

In 2049, everyone streamed their lives directly from their minds. Neural implants made it seamless — no phones, no cameras. Just thought, broadcasted in real-time. For Marcus Vale, a top-tier influencer with 80 million followers, it was his livelihood.

But then, the glitches began.

First, it was a thirty-second clip: him, asleep in a bed that wasn’t his, with a shadowy figure watching from the doorway. He dismissed it as a bug — a hacker’s prank.

Then came another: a rainy street, Marcus walking alone, only… older. Grey at the temples. Haunted. Looking over his shoulder like something followed him.

The Feed never recorded what didn’t happen. That was impossible.

Until it wasn’t.

The clips kept coming. Moments he never lived. Places he'd never been. A hospital corridor. A woman screaming his name. And finally — the worst one.

Marcus, bound to a chair. Mouth gagged. Blood pooling beneath him. And a masked figure whispering, [whispering] “We’ve been watching your feed too.”

He tried to go dark, shut off the implant. But the feed stayed live. People commented in real-time as the footage played on, even though Marcus was safe at home — wasn’t he?

He scrolled to the chat.
[shocked] "This isn't real, right?"
[gasps] "OMG is this a stunt?"
[thoughtful] "Wait… he’s wearing the same shirt as now."

Then came the final comment, just before the lights in his apartment cut out:
[whispering] "Look behind you."
