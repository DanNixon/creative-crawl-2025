# Stitches in the Dark

Voice: Grandpa Spuds Oxley

```text
In a small, forgotten town, a tailor named Elias worked late into the night, stitching intricate designs for wealthy clients. His hands were steady, but his mind often wandered to the old, ornate sewing machine that had been passed down through generations. It hummed with an eerie life of its own.

One stormy evening, Elias was stitching a particularly delicate gown when the machine began to move without him - its needle dancing furiously. Startled, he tried to stop it, but his hands wouldnâ€™t obey. The fabric twisted and contorted into something... someone.

The gown suddenly stood up, a pale figure wearing the dress, her hollow eyes locked onto Elias. She whispered, [whispers] "Thank you for finishing my dress."

Before Elias could speak, the figure reached out, and in a flash, he felt his body grow cold - his hands stiff, his soul tangled in thread.

Now, late every night, the machine hums again, stitching the souls of lost hobbyists into its creations, forever weaving in the shadows of the forgotten town.
