Voice: Samara X

```text
When the new line of smart prosthetics hit the market, they promised seamless integration—intuitive movement, adaptive grip, even voice feedback. But what nobody told the buyers was that these limbs weren’t just smart. They were alive.

Mark got his arm fitted last week. At first, it was incredible—his new hand moved almost on its own, and sometimes, late at night, it whispered his name. [whispering] When he listened closely, the voice wasn’t his own. It was someone else—soft, pleading.

He started hearing stories from other users: a woman’s leg reciting prayers in a dead language, a man’s hand laughing in a cold, hollow tone. They traced the issue back to the source: most of the limbs were harvested from black-market victims—bodies stolen, parts sold, memories and voices trapped in the circuits.

One night, Mark woke up to his prosthetic arm tightening around his throat, the voice saying, [gravelly voice] “I’m still here.”
