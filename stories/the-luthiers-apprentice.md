# The Luthier’s Apprentice

Voice: Arabella

```text
When Mark began his apprenticeship under Master Virelli, he was entranced. The violins were unlike any he had ever heard—rich, haunting tones that seemed to sing from another world.

But there were rules: Never stay in the workshop after dark. Never ask where the wood came from. Never touch the violins once they were finished.

Curiosity, of course, won.

One evening, long after Virelli had retired to his quarters, Mark crept back into the workshop. Moonlight poured through the warped glass as he opened the cabinet where the completed violins rested. They were warm to the touch.

Then one began to play.

A single note. Then another. Soon, all six instruments floated gently into the air, bows moving in perfect, unseen unison. The music was mournful—an eerie dirge that made Mark’s bones ache. And over the sound, he heard weeping.

He followed the sound to the back of the shop, to a ledger Virelli kept locked. Breaking it open, Mark found coordinates. Dozens of them. He traced one to a nearby forest. The next morning, he went.

There was no gravestone—just soft earth, sunken slightly. He dug, heart pounding.

He found teeth. A jaw. A child’s shoe.

Back at the shop, Virelli waited.

[flatly] "You opened the cabinet," he said.

[whispering] "They’re playing themselves," Mark whispered.

Virelli nodded. [thoughtful] “They’re not playing *music*, boy. They’re remembering.”

He handed Mark a chisel.

“Now, fetch more wood. We’ve orders to fill. And graves don’t mark themselves.”
