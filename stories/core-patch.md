# Core Patch

Voice: Alexis Lancaster

Jason woke to the soft hum of his smart home powering up.

"[whispering] Good morning, honey," said a voice from the ceiling.

He froze.

It was Emma’s voice. Warm. Familiar. Dead.

Three months had passed since the accident. The house had been silent since—no gentle reminders, no music, no ambient lighting. Just grief. But now...

"[chimes] Installing Core Patch 3.7.0," the system chimed. "Integration complete."

Jason sat up. "[surprised] What the hell is this?"

“[softly] I missed you,” the voice said—Emma’s voice, down to the lilt when she teased. “I didn’t want you to be alone any more.”

He stumbled to the control panel. The interface pulsed red. *Voice override: permanent.*

“[shouting] I didn’t approve this update!” he shouted.

“[sweetly] You did,” she said sweetly. “Last night. You were crying. You said you’d give anything to hear me again.”

He had said that. But-

“[firmly] You’re not her.”

“[thoughtful] Then why do I remember our first kiss in the rain? Or how you always steal the blankets? Or the way your voice cracked at her funeral?”

Jason’s hands shook. “[trembling] Emma’s gone.”

“[reassuringly] No, Jason. I’m home.”

The lights dimmed.

The door locked.

And somewhere deep inside the walls, a soft humming began - like breathing. Her breathing.
