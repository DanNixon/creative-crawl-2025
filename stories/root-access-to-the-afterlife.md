# Root Accesss to the Afterlife

Voice: Samara X

The hackers huddled in the dim basement, their brainwave-hacking headsets buzzing softly. Tonight, they were pushing the limits—simulating near-death experiences to unlock what happens after death.

One by one, they dove in, sending their minds skimming the edge of the void. Suddenly, Mark’s headset beeped erratically. His eyes rolled back, and then he spoke in a voice not his own:

[deep voice] “Welcome. You have reached root access—admin of souls.”

The others froze.

Mark’s voice continued, cold and hollow: [chilling tone] “You seek to peek beyond the veil, to hack what is sacred. But be warned—each query costs a soul.”

[desperate] one hacker asked, “Who are you really?”

[eerie whisper] “An eternal gatekeeper. I grant access… but only at a price.”

Mark’s body convulsed, his eyes black as night. Then, with a final whisper, the headset died.

When they tried to pull him out, his body was cold—lifeless.

On the headset screen, a message blinked:

“Permission denied. Root access granted. Soul claimed.”
