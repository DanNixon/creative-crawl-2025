# Last Light District

Voice: Jane

After the global grid collapse, the world fell into darkness. Entire cities lay in shadows—cold, silent, and starved of power. Except one place.

The Hope Zone.

Flickering at the city's heart, its neon glow pierced the black skies like a promise. The government said it was a sanctuary — food, warmth, safety. They called it the Last Light District. People lined up for days to get in.

But no one ever really came back. Not unchanged.

First was my brother, Eli. Drafted in exchange for food rations. He left smiling, waving through the chain-link gates. Six months later, he returned.

His smile hadn’t changed — wide, perfect, frozen. But his eyes were empty. He didn’t blink. He didn’t sleep. At night, I’d hear him whispering to the walls in a language that sounded mechanical. Like wires humming secrets.

One night, I followed him out. He wasn’t walking — he was gliding, like his feet no longer knew gravity. He joined others in the park. Silent. Standing in rows. Faces blank. All of them… glowing faintly. Like dim bulbs.

That’s when I realized: the Hope Zone doesn’t power people. It reprograms them.

I left the city the next morning. The lights behind me shimmered like a trap slowly closing.

And now, sometimes… Eli’s voice crackles through dead radios.

Still smiling. Still whispering.

[whispering] "Come home. The light is waiting."
