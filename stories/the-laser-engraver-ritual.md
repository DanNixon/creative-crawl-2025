# The Laser Engraver Ritual

Voice: Alice

```text
In the dim hum of the makerspace, Clara hunched over her laser engraver, the machine’s beam slicing into a steel plate. She’d found the sigil on a buried deep web forum—a jagged, spiraling glyph that pulsed in her mind. “Ancient, forbidden,” the post had whispered. Curious, she fed the design into the engraver, watching it burn the pattern with surgical precision.

That night, the makerspace was quiet, save for the faint whine of cooling fans. Clara showed the finished piece to her friends, Max and Lena, their faces lit by the steel’s eerie glow. The sigil seemed to writhe under the fluorescent lights. [muttering] “Cool,” Max muttered, but his voice faltered. Lena squinted, then gasped, clutching her face. Blood trickled from her eyes, staining her cheeks crimson. Max screamed, his own eyes welling red, tears of blood pooling on the floor.

Clara stumbled back, her vision blurring as warm liquid seeped down her face. In her mind, a dream took hold: she lay on a glowing altar, its surface pulsing with the same sigil. Shadowy figures loomed, their blades glinting, carving her flesh in perfect, endless spirals. She woke, [gasping] but the pain lingered. The makerspace was dark now, the steel plate glowing faintly on the table.

Max and Lena were gone. Blood smeared the floor, trailing to the door. Clara’s phone buzzed—a photo from Lena’s number. It showed Clara’s own face, eyes bleeding, smiling blankly on that glowing altar. The sigil burned brighter in her mind, [whispering] You’re next.
