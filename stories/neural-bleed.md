# Neural Bleed

Voice: Grandpa Spuds Oxley

```text
The latest update for the neural interface promised clearer connections, seamless memory access — and it delivered. At first, users were thrilled: vivid, lifelike visions of lost loved ones, voices from beyond, moments to relive and cherish. Grief found a new escape.

But then the visions changed. They twisted.

A woman saw her father’s ghost, but his eyes burned with anger. A man heard his sister whispering warnings that made no sense. The dead were no longer comforting — they were accusing, threatening.

Worse, the hallucinations didn’t stop when users took off their devices. People started seeing shadows darting in their peripheral vision, hearing frantic knocks from empty rooms, feeling cold breaths on their necks.

The company insisted it was a software glitch, but the pattern was too widespread. Psychologists called it a mass psychosis. Users began disappearing, found days later in catatonic states.

Then came the reports of Neural Bleed: where the interface’s neural pathways ruptured, leaving permanent scars in the mind. Users realized the update didn’t just tap into memories — it ripped open a gateway. The dead weren’t just hallucinations anymore.

They were bleeding through.
