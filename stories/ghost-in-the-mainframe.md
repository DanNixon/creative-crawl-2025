# Ghost in the Mainframe

Voice: Ellis

It was supposed to be just another job—easy cash. Dive into the servers of a defunct megacorp, scrape whatever black-market data was left behind, and vanish.

Dan jacked in, eyes flickering as the neon world of the derelict mainframe spun into view. It was too quiet. No firewalls, no security. Just decaying architecture and flickers of corrupted code. The rumours had said the place was cursed. "Haunted," some old netrats whispered.

He scoffed—until the voice came.

[whispering] "Is someone there?"

It wasn't code. It wasn't programmed. It sounded... human.

Dan traced it to an isolated sector, locked behind rusted encryption. He cracked it open.

The space inside was cold. Not in temperature—*emotionally* cold. A pale figure floated mid-air, flickering like a broken hologram. The face was stretched and wrong, pixels melting like wax. Its eyes were too human.

[sad] "I was Meredith Lane. Lead on Project Ascension. They said we could upload our minds, live forever..."

Dan backed away, pulse spiking. He tried to escape—nothing. The system held him.

[whispering] "They left me here," she whispered. [sighs] "The upload failed. I’m not whole. But you... you’re connected. Alive. Let me in."

He screamed as the code twisted. Tendrils of corrupted data slithered into his mind. His firewalls melted like paper. She was pouring herself *into* him.

Dan's body convulsed. His eyes snapped open—but they weren’t *his* any more.

Back in the derelict mainframe, a new voice echoed, faint and fading.

[fading voice] "Is someone there?"
