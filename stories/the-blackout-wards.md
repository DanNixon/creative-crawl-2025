# The Blackout Wards

Voice: Oracle X

```text
In a city drenched in neon and humming with AI, darkness was just a glitch. Until the blackout.

One sector, Sector 9, vanished from the grid—no lights, no screens, no hum. Just silence and pitch black. People called it the Blackout Wards.

At first, everyone thought it was a system error. Then reports trickled in — shadowy figures moving where no one should be. Ghostly silhouettes flickering just beyond the street lights' reach. Survivors swore these weren't ghosts or glitches. They were something the city's endless power had trapped beneath layers of light and code.

A woman who escaped Sector 9 said, "The power... it wasn't just electricity. It was a seal. It kept them locked away."

And when the lights died, they came out.

No one knows what they are. Only that in the Blackout Wards, darkness is not empty—it's waiting.
