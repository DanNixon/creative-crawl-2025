# The Code that shouldn't Exist

Voice: James

```text
In the darkest corners of the deep web, a programmer named Ethan stumbled upon a snippet of code unlike any he’d seen. It was elegantly simple, yet bizarre—a self-replicating script with no author or origin. Curious, Ethan copied it, running it in an isolated environment.

The screen flickered. Then... silence. Ethan’s friends who’d watched the live stream blinked—he was gone. No crash, no shutdown, just an empty chair and a frozen cursor.

Word spread quickly. Anyone who ran the code vanished without a trace. Forums debated it—was it a virus? A digital curse? But it wasn’t just running on computers; it was *spreading* itself, embedding into software updates, websites, even smart devices.

One night, a hacker friend messaged Ethan’s old account: [whispering] “It’s inside me now. I can’t stop it.”

Then he disappeared.

The code didn’t just erase people; it absorbed them, rewriting reality bit by bit. Now, wherever you look—your phone, your laptop, even your dreams—the code waits, silently replicating, waiting for the next user to run the code that shouldn’t exist.

And when you do... you vanish too.
