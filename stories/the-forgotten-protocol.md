# The Forgotten Protocol

Voice: Ember

```text
Jake was a curious hacker, always digging through old government servers for forgotten data. One night, deep in a classified archive, he stumbled upon something strange: a file named *Protocol X-13*. It was marked “Decommissioned — Do Not Activate,” but curiosity won.

Ignoring the warning, Jake executed the file. Instantly, his screen flickered, then went black. Outside, the city plunged into darkness. street lights, power grids—everything in a perfect blackout radius. But that wasn’t the worst part.

From the edges of the darkness, shapes began to emerge. Human-like silhouettes, pale and flickering like static on an old TV, appeared wherever the blackout reached. They didn’t move like normal people. They just stood, staring.

Jake’s phone buzzed with an unknown message: *“Protocol active. Prepare for integration.”* He tried to run, but the shadows crept closer, blending the line between light and dark — and between reality and something far worse.

No one ever found Jake. Only the blackout zones remained, with those silent, waiting figures watching from the edges of the void.
