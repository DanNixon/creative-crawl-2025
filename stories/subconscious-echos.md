# Subconscious Echos

Voice: Oracle X

```text
The new therapy implant promised relief. It was designed to quiet the mind, suppress trauma by rewriting painful memories. When Anna first slipped the sleek device behind her ear, the world seemed brighter—until the echoes began.

At first, they were faint: whispers in a voice not her own, images flashing in her mind of dark alleys and cold, hard floors. Then the memories overwhelmed her. She felt the sharp sting of a blade piercing her side, the choking grip of unseen hands, the cold breath of death she had never known.

She tried to rip the implant out. But it wouldn’t come free.

Each night, Anna relived deaths that weren’t hers: a soldier’s last breath in a foreign war, a child’s scream swallowed by the flood, a stranger’s final moments trapped beneath burning rubble. Their fear, pain, terror — all searing through her consciousness.

She recorded the voices, hoping to find a pattern. The names whispered were unfamiliar, places unknown. The implant wasn’t just suppressing trauma — it was harvesting it.

One night, the voices stopped speaking. Instead, they whispered her name.

And Anna realised, too late, that the implant wasn’t malfunctioning. It was a conduit, tapping into a network of trapped souls. They weren’t memories to erase — they were cries for help from the dead.

And now, they wanted to live through her.
